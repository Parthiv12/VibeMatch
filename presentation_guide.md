# VibeMatch - Presentation Guide

## Project Overview (1-2 minutes)
- Introduce VibeMatch: A deep learning song recommendation system
- Explain the problem: Recommending songs based on mood and emotional energy
- Mention the core technologies used: PyTorch, TensorFlow, audio processing libraries

## Project Structure (1-2 minutes)
- Show the project directory structure
  ```
  python -c "import os; print('\n'.join([f for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isdir(f) or f.endswith('.py')]))"
  ```
- Highlight key components:
  - `models/vibe_encoder.py`: The neural network architecture
  - `preprocessing/audio_processor.py`: Audio feature extraction
  - `training/train.py`: Model training script
  - `recommend.py`: Recommendation system
  - `demo.py`: Interactive demo

## Model Architecture (2-3 minutes)
- Open and explain `models/vibe_encoder.py`
- Highlight the Variational Autoencoder structure:
  - Dimensionality reduction (169,344 -> 2048)
  - Encoder layers (2048 -> 1024 -> 512 -> 256)
  - Latent space (64 dimensions)
  - Decoder layers (256 -> 512 -> 1024 -> 2048 -> 169,344)
- Explain the loss functions (reconstruction, KL divergence, triplet loss)

## Audio Processing (2-3 minutes)
- Open and explain `preprocessing/audio_processor.py`
- Show the feature extraction process:
  - Loading and normalizing audio
  - Extracting mel spectrograms
  - Using VGGish embeddings
  - Combining features

## Training Process (2-3 minutes)
- Show the training script (`training/train.py`)
- Run a quick demonstration of the training logs:
  ```
  cat checkpoints/training_log.txt
  ```
- Explain how the model learns:
  - From 5.11 loss in epoch 1 to 3.72 loss in epoch 10
  - Learning the latent space representation of songs

## Recommendation System (2-3 minutes)
- Open and explain `recommend.py`
- Show how recommendations are made:
  - Building a song database
  - Extracting features for a query song
  - Calculating similarity in latent space
  - Ranking similar songs

## Live Demo (3-5 minutes)
- Run the prepared demo script with The Weeknd's "Open Hearts":
  ```
  python demo.py path/to/open_hearts.mp3
  ```
- Wait for the system to:
  1. Process the song
  2. Predict its mood
  3. Find similar songs
  4. Display top 5 recommendations
- Explain the results and why certain songs were recommended

## Future Improvements (1-2 minutes)
- Mention potential enhancements:
  - Adding more mood categories beyond "energetic" and "happy"
  - Incorporating lyric analysis
  - Building a user feedback loop
  - Creating a web interface

## Conclusion (1 minute)
- Summarize what we've learned
- Emphasize the deep learning concepts used:
  - Autoencoders
  - Feature extraction
  - Regularization
  - Transfer learning (VGGish)
- Thank the audience

## Technical Setup Tips:
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
2. Have The Weeknd's "Open Hearts" song ready in a known location
3. Test the demo ahead of time to ensure it works properly
4. Keep terminal and code editor windows open and arranged for easy viewing
5. Set font size large enough for viewers to read code and terminal output
